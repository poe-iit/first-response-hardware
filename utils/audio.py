    Although I moved this function to a different thread, it still fights for

    To prevent that, I tore the function apart and yielded at every moment where
    this function does not need to run
    A lot like how JavaScript event loops work

    It's made the alarm/crossing tasks run in parallel and less janky to look at/hear
